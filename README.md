# packman
Simple demo to show using javascript to move a packman across the screen (opening and closing his mouth as every good packman does).  When he reaches the end of the screen he turns around and does it again in the opposite direction!

To use this:
 * Clone this repo.
 * From the cloned directory, drag the index.html file into a web browser.  It's that easy!
